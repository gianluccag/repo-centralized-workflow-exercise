Spaghetti a la Carbonara

Ingredients:
- 150 grams type 1 or 2 spaghetti
- 2 eggs
- 100 grams pancetta
- 4 garlic cloves
- a healthy splash of olive oil
- 100 grams parmegiano
- salt to taste
- pepper
- ground nutmeg



Steps:
1. Slice the garlic in small discs and cut the pancetta in small cubes.
2. Put the pasta to boil al dente
3. MEANWHILE: 
	3.1. fry the garlic and pancetta in a frying pan, medium heat, a drop of olive oil
	3.2. grate the cheese fine 
	3.3. seperate one egg yolk from the white (you can discard one of the egg whites)
4. Mix in a large bowl the the pancetta, garlic, grated cheese, 1 egg and 1 egg yolk and some olive oil
5. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to the mixture to taste
6. When the pasta is ready, rinse it directly (save some of the pasta water) and add it directly to the mixture in the bowl.
7. Add a little bit of the pasta water to emulsify.
8. ENJOY!

Caution: the salt balance is tricky and it can get easily out of hand. The pancetta might have some salt 
added to it, salt is added to the pasta water and the mixture has salt. BE CAREFUL AND RATHER ADD EXTRA SALT AFTERWARDS
